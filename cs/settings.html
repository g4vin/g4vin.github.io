                        your hit reg is spot on or you're lagging all over the

                        players do not properly configure their settings, and
                        would be doing so much better with a few minutes of
                        configuring them.</p><br />

                       <a name="version"></a> <h2>What version of cs 1.6</h2>
			
                        <p>First I'll cover choosing the right version of cs.
                        As of 4/21/13, there are three main ways to run cs
                        1.6.</p>

                        <p>To run the official new steam version, just buy it
                        <a href=
                        "http://store.steampowered.com/app/10/">here</a> its
                        only $10, and goes on sale for as low as $2.50
                        sometimes. You also get Counter-Strike: Condition Zero
                        with it. This is worth several times its price. If you
                        do not have a credit card, buy a steam giftcard, or a
                        visa giftcard, etc.</p>

                        <p>Deprecated option: run the old 2009 build 4554
                        version on steam. This is a work around from when the
                        Febuary 2013 steampipe update came out with lots of
                        bugs. Most of the bugs have been patched since then and
                        the newest steam cs provides the best experience
                        currently. If you need to talk with nonsteam clients,
                        this version is needed, but you will not be able to
                        talk with other legit steam players with this method as
                        the new update switched the voice codecs. This is a
                        little bit tricky to set up, so don't try this if you
                        don't have patience, follow guide <a href=
                        "oldcs.html">here</a>.</p>

                        <p>The third option is to use a nonsteam client. This
                        is a last resort, support the developers and buy it as
                        linked above. If your going to use a nonsteam client,
                        use cswarzone (google it you leeching
                        parasite).</p><br />

                        <a name="configure"></a> <h1>Configuring CS</h1>

                        <p>This guide is written for the new steam cs 1.6, but
                        most of this applies to all other versions, differences
                        in notation between them will be noted in extreme
                        cases.</p>

                        <a name="ingame"></a> <h2>In Game Settings</h2>

                        <p>Most settings can be set in game, it's easiest
                        usually to first launch cs and change settings before
                        going into config files.</p>
						
						<p>Start by setting your name, spray, and crosshair preferences. I like the light blue(teal translucent color) soft on eyes(doesn't blend in with anything unless your on fy_poolday.
						Maybe in a later guide I'll provide instructions for custom sprays. On the keyboard tab you can change the key for certain in game functions,
						see later part in guide for binding in userconfig.</p>
						
						<p>For the mouse tab, you want mouse look enabled, mouse filter turned off, and raw input enabled mainly. Mouse filter would make you less accurate. Rawinput disables all mouse accel by
						default, and is most reliable form of input. I highly recommend switching if you haven't already, though you will need to rediscover your favorite sensitivity. Pros in cs use low sensitivities
						and move there mouse with their arms not their wrists. Using a joystick puts you at a massive disadvantage against the competition. All servers disable autoaim, so don't bother leaving it on.
						<img src="images/2013-05-26_00001.jpg" alt="Mouse settings" height="640" width="480"> </p>
						<p>Set audio and voice to your liking based on preference.</p>
						<p>Now for video settings. OpenGL should always be the renderer, as software mode looks terrible. D3D is no longer a choice in the new cs, as it was buggy, and made making wallhacks easy.
						CS was designed for lower resolutions,so I recommend playing at either 1024 x 768, 800 x 600, or 640 x 480. I use 800 x 600. Recoil will be the same at any resolution as it is serverside.
						<img src="images/2013-05-26_00002.jpg" alt="Mouse settings" height="640" width="480"> </p>
						<p>Set voice to whatever you like, and not sure who actually uses the content lock, but don't mess with that</p>
						<p>For much more customization, you need to create a userconfig and set launch settings as linked below</p>
                        <a name="userconfig"></a><h2>Creating a userconfig!</h2>

                        <p>Navigate to the Half-Life folder in
                        steamapps/common. Usually its in C:/Program
                        Files/Steam/Steamapps/common/. Inside you should see a
                        cstrike and a platform amoung other folders at a
                        minimum. Create a new folder named cstrike_addon, now
                        your folder should look something like this, note I
                        also have Half-Life installed in this screenshot.
                        <img src="images/hldir.jpg" /> Enter the cstrike_addon
                        folder. This is the new place to put custom resources
                        for cs to use, such as maps, models, config files, etc,
                        so you no longer need to mix your custom files with the
                        vanila game files. The first thing we are going to add
                        a userconfig.cfg file, a file that servers cannot edit
                        with settings we want consistently in cs such as
                        netcode, sensitivity, etc. Download <a href=
                        "http://files.computoid.com/userconfig.cfg">this</a>
                        and save it to your cstrike_addons folder(right click
                        save link as/ save link target as.) A userconfig can be
                        broken up into 4 main parts. Netcode, performance,
                        binds, and preferences.</p><br />

                        <a name="netcode"></a><h3>Netcode</h3>

                        <p>rate - Amount of data you recieve from a server.
                        Ping increases as rate increases. Generally you want a
                        rate around 25000. While in the 2013 updates, the
                        raised the max value to 100000, at time of writing few
                        servers can handle that without massive lag or even
                        have an sv_maxrate that high.</p>

                        <p>cl_cmdrate - Should be higher than frames per
                        second, max amount of packets you send to the server.
                        For 100 fps (you should have 100 fps in game), I've
                        been using 105. This is too high if you are getting
                        loss on netgraph and means you are not updating fast
                        enough.</p>

                        <p>cl_updaterate - Amount of updates you are requesting
                        from ther server. 100 was supposed to be max, but to
                        cut down on support tickets, they raised it to 102. I
                        use 102. Lower this if you are on a shit server that
                        can't send enough updates, causing choke on
                        netgraph.</p>

                        <p>ex_interp - Sets the amount of time (in seconds) to
                        interpolate in between each successive
                        update(cl_updaterate). If cl_updaterate is 100, this
                        will automatically calculate correct interp. I force
                        this to 0.01. Peope with bad internet are known to use
                        .1 .Calculated 1/cl_updaterate.</p>

                        <p>cl_nosmooth - Determines whether to correct model
                        abruptly when prediction is wrong. You want this set to
                        1 so your shots aren't missing.</p>

                        <p>Other netcode notes: Feel free to experiment with
                        these settings, test them on different servers. Don't
                        mess with fpsmodem, cl_rate, etc the net settings here
                        are the only ones you should change. Some servers force
                        rates on people for various reasons. On lan, your rate
                        setting does not matter as sv_lanrate is used by the
                        server</p><br />

                        <a name="performance"></a> <h3>Performance</h3>

                        <p>Counter-strike is an old game with low system
                        requirements, so not many performance settings need to
                        be manually set in a userconfig.</p>

                        <p>In order to get good hit registration, in cs you
                        want to limit your fps. CS was designed to run at 100
                        fps. So first turn off vync with gl_vsync 0. Then you
                        want to cap your fps_max at 99.5 with fps_max "99.5".
                        Since the new cs update, in order to get exactly 100
                        fps, you need to set it to 99.5. If you are running an
                        older version of cs, set fps_max to 100.</p>

                        <p>snd_noextraupdate to "1" means that cs will not use
                        extra sound updates, so you will have better fps
                        according to alfred at valve. There is no reason this
                        should be set to "0".</p>

                        <p>gl_ansio "0" turns off antialiasing, so you'll have
                        smoother fps and gameplay.</p>

                        <p>Here are the opengl graphics modes. I use the
                        default one, but if you have a really good computer or
                        a bad computer, feel free to try one of these.(don't
                        put them all in your config)</p>

                        <a name="bind"></a><h3>Binds</h3> 

                        <p>Binding is a useful tool to make playing cs easier,
                        and faster. The main use of binding in cs, is making
                        buying easier and faster, as often the buy period is
                        really short and it gets really tiresome buying stuff
                        manually. Another use is to relocated buttons to easier
                        places. I set c to use microphone, as pressing k is
                        really akward when holding a mouse. Below is my
                        binds(also included in the above userconfig. I am no
                        means an expert in binding, look elsewhere if you want
                        more detailed binding instructions and scripts.</p>

                        <p>bind "F3" "m4a1; ak47; primammo; deagle; secammo;
                        vesthelm; defuser; flash; hegren; sgren; nvgs;
                        flash"<br />
                        bind "F4" "deagle; secammo; flash; hegren; sgren; nvgs;
                        defuser; shield; vesthelm"<br />
                        bind "F5" "awp; primammo; deagle; secammo; flash;
                        hegren; sgren; nvgs; defuser; vesthelm"<br />
                        bind "c" "+voicerecord"<br />
                        bind "k" "radio3"</p>

                        <a name="preference"></a><h3>Preferences</h3> 

                        <p>In the preferences section, I put settings that I do
                        not change often. By putting them in your
                        userconfig.cfg, you have slowhack protection, so a
                        server cannot make you loose your favorite mouse
                        sensitivity or volume for example. If you have settings
                        you like, you can copy them from config.cfg.</p>

                        <p>I recommend you use rawinput, as it provides better
                        mouse movement and such than the mouse going through
                        windows. m_rawinput 1 turns this on.</p>

                        <a name="launch"></a> <h2>Launch settings</h2>

                        <p>Some cs settings must be passed command line and
                        cannot be changed in game via console or config files.
                        After the Febuary 2013 update, many launch settings
                        became deprecated and implemented as in game cvars.</p>

                        <p>To set your launch options for cs, in steam library
                        right click counter-strike and click properties and
                        then click set launch options.</p>

                        <p>-nofbo Recommends you add this launch switch to
                        force cs to use the old rendering method(faster). If
                        you just want to turn off antialiasing for the new cs,
                        use -nomsaa . You can force your resolution with -w and
